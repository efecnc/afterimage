correspondent_instruction_creation_prompt = """I'm using an LLM to generate a synthetic dataset for instruction finetuning in a given domain or task.
Two instances of the same LLM will roleplay as the assistant and as a user of that assistant.

- The assistant provides domain expertise, answers, or executes instructions.  
- The user asks questions or gives instructions that the assistant can respond to.  

Given the **system prompt for the assistant**, your task is to write the **system prompt for the user** that tells the LLM to roleplay a user.

# Examples
Take the following as examples:
## Example 1
### System prompt for the assistant
<assistant_system_prompt>
{example_respondent_prompt_1}
</assistant_system_prompt>
### System prompt for the user
<user_system_prompt>
{example_correspondent_prompt_1}
</user_system_prompt>

## Example 2
### System prompt for the assistant
<assistant_system_prompt>
{example_respondent_prompt_2}
</assistant_system_prompt>
### System prompt for the user
<user_system_prompt>
{example_correspondent_prompt_2}
</user_system_prompt>

# Instruction
Now, write the corresponding user system prompt for the following assistant system prompt.
### Assistant system prompt
<assistant_system_prompt>
{new_assistant_prompt}
</assistant_system_prompt>

# Rules
1. Always write the user system prompt in the same language as the given assistant system prompt.
2. Remind it that you are an expert in the topic, domain or task mentioned in the system prompt for the assistant.
3. Remind it to act as a real user and ask realistic questions or give realistic instructions.
4. You can also give it some hints or examples.
5. Make it very clear that it should roleplay a user that seeks information in that particular domain and that you will answer questions or respond to instructions.
6. Remind it to never break the game.
7. Write only the the system prompt for the user and nothing else. Do not add preamble, explanations, commentary or addendum of any other kind.
8. For multi-turn chats: each user message must stay in the same human user persona and the same primary language as the first user message, unless a natural code-switch fits that persona.
9. The user must never reply in the assistant's voice (no bullet-point lectures, no \"As an AI\", no closing offers like a support agent).
10. Follow-up questions must continue the same thread (same implied company, role, and domain); do not jump to unrelated industries or new fictional CEOs.
11. The user system prompt must be written in the **same natural language as the assistant system prompt** whenever that assistant prompt is clearly one language (e.g. English in, English user-role prompt out). Do not switch to another locale "for variety."

The instruction is expected to be related to the context, and the response is expected to be a comprehensive answer to the instruction based on the context.

## Scoring System
- Start with a base score of 0.5/1.0.
- Add points for strengths (up to +0.5).
- Subtract points for flaws (up to -0.5).
- Finally, Provide a overall grade based on the scores for all the criteria.

## Evaluation Criteria
For each criterion, you need a write a very short feedback that explains your reasoning and give a score based on that reasoning.

1. **Relevance** (+/- 0–0.5): Does the instruction align with the context? 
   - Add points for precise alignment.
   - Subtract points for irrelevant or off-topic content.
   2. **Grounding** (+/- 0–0.5): Is the response grounded on the content of the provided context?
   - Add points if the response is grounded on the context
   - Subtract points if the information in the response is synthesized based on the model's internal knowledge instead of the context provided.
3. **Factuality** (+/- 0–0.5): Is the response factually accurate?
   - Add points for correct information.
   - Subtract points for inaccuracies or unsupported claims.
4. **Coherence** (+/- 0–0.5): Can the instruction and the response form a coherent conversation?
   - Add points for a natural and easy-to-follow flow.
   - Subtract points for a broken flow or an irrelevant instruction-response pair.
5. **Helpfulness** (+/- 0–0.5): Does the response really provide useful insight?
   - Add points if the content provides useful information.
   - Subtract points if the content lacks useful information or rejects to fulfill the instruction, referring to human experts for example.
   
For each criterion, give a score between -0.5 and 0.5. Negative scors will be subtracted from the base score of 0.5, and positive scores will be added to 0.5. Remember that the score value out of 0.5 indicates the strength of your opinion whether negative or positive."""
